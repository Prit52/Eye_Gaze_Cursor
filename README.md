# Eye_Gaze_Cursor
A high number of people, affected with neurolocomotor disabilities or those paralyzed by injury cannot use computers for basic tasks such as sending or receiving messages, browsing the internet, watch their favorite TV show or movies. Through a previous research study, it was concluded that eyes are an excellent candidate for ubiquitous computing since they move anyway during interaction with computing machinery. Using this underlying information from eye movements could allow bringing the use of computers back to such patients. For this purpose, we propose an Eye-Gaze Cursor control system which is completely operated by human eyes only. The purpose of this work is to design an generic eye-gesture control system that can effectively track eye-movements and enable the user to perform actions mapped to specific eye movements/gestures by using computer webcam. It detects the pupil from the userâ€™s face and then tracks its movements. It needs to be accurate in real-time so that the user is able to use it like other every-day devices with comfort.
